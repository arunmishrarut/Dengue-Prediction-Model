**Dengue Prediction Model (Singapore)**

Predicting weekly dengue outbreaks in Singapore using climate data and ML models.

Data Sources:-
Dengue cases: Weekly reports from data.gov.sg

Weather data: Mean temperature & rainfall from WeatherSpark

Objective:
Build a model to predict high-risk dengue outbreak weeks based on weather patterns to support proactive public health interventions.

Key Findings
Dengue outbreaks correlate with higher temperatures (28–29°C) and low rainfall.

Logistic regression performed best and generalized well.
